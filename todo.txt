DONE we'll need synchronization of some kind - to make sure internal maps are written once.
    ConcurrentMap + private synchronized "determine" methods to do double check in the map.

Should we throw PINFException? Or just pass along SQLException...?

connection.getTypeMap()  // interesting - might be worth checking into.

todo test stored proc calls - all read methods!

// read a DAO by primary key and return true if found. Object should be not null. t cannot be null
public boolean read(Object object) throws PersismException;

// read a DAO or primitive by class and SQL
public <T> T read(Class<T> objectClass, String sql, Object... parameters) throws PersismException;


Add a ResultSet class with similar interface to java.sql.ResultSet
but it would be read-only and disconnected and would not throw any SQLException
Add method in Query class for it. executeSQL or executeQuery.
