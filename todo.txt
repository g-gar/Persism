DONE we'll need synchronization of some kind - to make sure internal maps are written once.
    ConcurrentMap + private synchronized "determine" methods to do double check in the map.

Should we throw PINFException? Or just pass along SQLException...?

connection.getTypeMap()  // interesting - might be worth checking into.

// read a DAO by primary key and return true if found. Object should be not null. t cannot be null
public boolean read(Object object) throws PersismException;

// read a DAO or primitive by class and SQL
public <T> T read(Class<T> objectClass, String sql, Object... parameters) throws PersismException;


Add a ResultSet class with similar interface to java.sql.ResultSet
but it would be read-only and disconnected and would not throw any SQLException
Add method in Query class for it. executeSQL or executeQuery.

ADD Firebird?
Add Sybase?

Back to Java 6 for instrumentation since it doesn't work under Java 8
- Put back JTDS
- Set Ant to 1.8.2

Note for next release. Renamed Command executeSQL to execute

NOPE this would be a downcast
net.sf.persism.PersismException: argument type mismatch Object class com.thermallube.revision.models.SalesOrderAllocation. Column: AllocationType Type of property: byte - Type read: class java.lang.Short VALUE: 0

TODO Handle X words Tax - Taxes, Fax - Faxes - plural rules

todo     @Column(name = "IsCompound") - yeah we do a simple "is" check but I need to think about this. See determinePropertyInfo
         private boolean compound; Find "Is" Columns so we don't need the annotation? OR just name the field isCompound - gets and sets seem to generate fine... BUT IT FAILS LOOKING FOR "compound" as the property name!s
