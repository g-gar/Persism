DONE we'll need synchronization of some kind - to make sure internal maps are written once.
    ConcurrentMap + private synchronized "determine" methods to do double check in the map.

Should we throw PINFException? Or just pass along SQLException...?

connection.getTypeMap()  // interesting - might be worth checking into.

Add a ResultSet class with similar interface to java.sql.ResultSet
but it would be read-only and disconnected and would not throw any SQLException
Add method in Query class for it. executeSQL or executeQuery.

ADD Firebird? Done.
Add Sybase DB2 Ingres Informix hsqldb? .....

TODO Note for next release. Renamed Command executeSQL to execute - made package private

TODO Handle X words Tax - Taxes, Fax - Faxes - plural rules

todo     @Column(name = "IsCompound") - yeah we do a simple "is" check but I need to think about this. See determinePropertyInfo
         private boolean compound; Find "Is" Columns so we don't need the annotation? OR just name the field isCompound - gets and sets seem to generate fine... BUT IT FAILS LOOKING FOR "compound" as the property name!s
