INSERT Statements
Question on how to insert and retrieve defaults or other generated values back (this works) UNLESS the default
happens to be the primary key which is not an autoinc (like a GUID).
FORGET IT. It requires custom insert statements different for different DBs AND DIFFERENT FOR THE SAME CLASS
and is not supported by statement.getGeneratedKeys()

IF you have a GUID primary key or other String based Primary key, you need to set it in JAVA.

ALSO: Removing the concept of multiple columns as a primary key - stupid and gay.
